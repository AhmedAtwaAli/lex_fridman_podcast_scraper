Quick note from Lex: The camera on Magnus died 20 minutes in. Most folks still just listen to audio-only version, but here on YouTube, we did our best to still make it interesting to watch & listen by adding image overlays. I mess things up sometimes, like in this case, and it hits me hard when I do. But I'm always working hard to improve. I hope you understand. Thank you for your patience and support along the way. I love you all.

CORRECTIONS:
- I'm currently hiring folks to help me with editing and image overlays so there may be some errors in overlays (as in this episode) as we build up a team. I ask for your patience.
- At 1 hour 27 minute mark, we overlay an image of Brian Greene. We meant to overlay an image of Michael Green, an early pioneer of string theory: https://bit.ly/michael-green-physicist
- The image overlay of the heliocentric model is incorrect.

EDIT NOTE: I edited this episode quickly and made a couple of mistakes in how rough the cut looks. One weird cut is after the 2 hour mark, where it sounds like Bret is about to make a point, but I actually interrupt him for clarification and then go of on a tangent and never return. I edited out the interruption which made the cut look weird. I failed here both as an interviewer and editor. I'm trying to get better at both, and hire help for the latter, since I still do it all alone. Please be patient with me.

In 1985, he received the Turing Award for his research in the theory of algorithms, including the development of the Edmonds–Karp algorithm for solving the maximum flow problem on networks, Hopcroft–Karp algorithm for finding maximum cardinality matchings in bipartite graphs, and his landmark paper in complexity theory called ""Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems"", in which he proved 21 problems to be NP-complete. This paper was probably the most important catalyst in the explosion of interest in the study of NP-completeness and the P vs NP problem.

I came across Dmitry's work when in February his group used the viral genome of the COVID-19 to reconstruct the 3D structure of its major viral proteins and their interactions with human proteins, in effect creating a structural genomics map of the coronavirus and making this data open and available to researchers everywhere. We talked about the biology of COVID-19, SARS, and viruses in general, and how computational methods can help us understand their structure and function in order to develop antiviral drugs and vaccines.

He is the originator and popularizer of a lot of fascinating ideas in evolutionary biology and science in general, including funny enough the introduction of the word meme in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene, which in the context of a gene-centered view of evolution is an exceptionally powerful idea. He is outspoken, bold, and often fearless in his defense of science and reason, and in this way, is one of the most influential thinkers of our time.

* Note about the new addition on the table: Hedgy is a stuffed hedgehog toy that I got in a thrift store many years ago. He jumped out at me because he seemed to be deep in thought and bothered by something profound, in stark contrast to other stuffed animals that usually have an aloof, empty smile on their face. I gave away almost all my stuff in the name of minimalism a couple of times, and he survived all of that. There's a longer story there. If you're curious, ask me and I'll do one of the AMA videos about Hedgy. In general, people asked to put more stuff in the scene. I don't have much stuff. So what you get is Hedgy.

She co-wrote the 1980 science documentary series Cosmos hosted by Carl Sagan, whom she married in 1981, and her love for whom, with the help of NASA, was recorded as brain waves on a golden record along with other things our civilization has to offer and launched into space on the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft that are now, 42 years later, still active, reaching out farther into deep space than any human-made object ever has. This was a profound and beautiful decision she made as a Creative Director of NASA's Voyager Interstellar Message Project. In 2014, she went on to create the second season of Cosmos, called Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, and in 2020, the new third season called Cosmos: Possible Worlds, which is being released this upcoming Monday, March 9. It is hosted, once again, by the fun and brilliant Neil deGrasse Tyson.

I'm releasing this podcast to coincide with the release of his new series called Devs that will premiere this Thursday, March 5, on Hulu as part of ""FX on Hulu"". It explores many of the themes this very podcast is about: from quantum mechanics to artificial life to simulation to the modern nature of power in the tech world.
